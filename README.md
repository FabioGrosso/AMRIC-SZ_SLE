## 3rd party libraries/tools

* Zstandard (https://facebook.github.io/zstd/). Zstandard v1.4.5 is included and will be used if libzstd can not be found by
  pkg-config.

## Installation

* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[INSTALL_DIR] ..
* make
* make install

Then, you'll find all the executables in [INSTALL_DIR]/bin and header files in [INSTALL_DIR]/include

## Testing Examples

You can use the executable 'sz3' command to do the compression/decompression.

SZ3 simplifies command line arguments in the previous version. If you are a new user, please follow the instructions
given by the executable.


## Backward Compatibility with SZ2
For backward compatibility, most of the SZ2 command line parameters are supported in SZ3. **Exceptions are listed below**.
Scripts without parameters below should work fine by replacing SZ2 with SZ3.

| Parameter | Explanation                     | SZ3 roadmap                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| -c        | Config file                     | SZ3 has different config format with SZ2 |
| -p        | Print configuration info        | Will be supported soon                   |
| -T        | Tucker Tensor Decomposition     | Will be supported later                  |
| -P        | Point-wise relative error bound | Will be supported later                  |


## API

Please refer to 'include/SZ3/api/sz.hpp' for API and instructions. SZ3 API is different with SZ2.
